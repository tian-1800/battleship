### About

A vanila javascript implementation of the board game "Battleship", as instructed by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/battleship) curriculum. The main purpose is to practice on unit testing using Jest. I also try to get more familiarity with sCSS styling.
